    Horiseon marketing website:

    Refactored code to make navigation of the CSS and HTML more accessible to Coders and users with operational dysfunctions.

    The purpose of refactoring this code was not to change the look but to make it easier for people to later identify where certain sections of the CSS editiing code is located- also adding certain tags to pictures for people who must use certain assitance tools like TTS.

    This refactoring will save alot of time for those who will later edit the code and also provide more accessibility to the website, providing incentive for all users to return to the site at a later date.

    through refactoring this code i learned that it is necessary to have a website that can be accessed by all personnel and must take the time in development to add these features in to maximize traffic to the website.
